# Demo Description

The demo shows:
- An exam-style registration form opened on Android
- Accessibility numbered overlay visible
- Explanation of how the agent navigates and interacts with UI elements

Due to modern Android (v15) security restrictions,
live automation of web forms is limited.
Therefore, the demo focuses on **agent behavior and logic**,
which remains applicable to real exam portals.
